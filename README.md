# Speed-Music-Machine-2020
# A forked version of an Meteor application for the Responsive Website Tutorial and Examples class (2nd. week) @ University of London
# Runs on Meteor 1.10

VERY IMPORTANT 
    before running this app, run the following command:
    meteor npm install --save @babel/runtime

This project is for the course Responsive website tutorials and examples, (second week)

## steps:
1.  `main.html`

    changed the <title> 

2. `playground.js`

    created a 10 new Maxim () objects.
    loaded the song files with the newly created Maxim () object.
    added the stopOrPlay <song-name> function for each play/stop button.
    added the the playAll (), stopAll (), functions for the main button.
    added the setSpeed ​​() function for the slider.
    added template helpers for each song.
    added template event functions for each "play / stop" button.

3. `main.js`

    changed the names and values ​​for insert. All values ​​were set to 0 except the one for the slide which was 50. The reason for it 
    is so that the sounds do not turn on all at once after a reset of the collection.

4. `playground.html`

    added a row including a play / stop button for each song file.

5. `main.css`

    I made all the necessary changes to make the application to my liking.
